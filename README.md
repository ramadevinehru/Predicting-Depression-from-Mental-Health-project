Depression Prediction Using Mental Health Survey Data
Overview:
This project is a Depression Prediction Web Application built using Python, Streamlit, and PyTorch. It analyzes mental health survey data to predict whether an individual is likely to experience depression based on various lifestyle, psychological, and demographic factors. The application enables real-time prediction by collecting inputs from users through an intuitive interface, making it suitable for both students and working professionals.

Features:
Real-time Predictions:
Depression Classification: Classifies whether a user is likely to be depressed or not using a pre-trained neural network.

Data Input:
Users can enter personal, lifestyle, and emotional attributes directly into the web interface.

Preprocessing Pipeline:

Missing Value Handling:
Categorical values filled with 'Unknown'
Numerical values filled with median values

Label Encoding:
Categorical variables are encoded using LabelEncoder

Feature Scaling:
Standardization of numerical features using StandardScaler

Consistent Feature Alignment:
Ensures that training and inference features match exactly

Model:
Architecture:
Model: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Input Layer: Matches number of selected categorical + numerical features

Hidden Layers:

First Layer: 64 neurons + ReLU + Dropout (0.3)

Second Layer: 32 neurons + ReLU

Output Layer: 1 neuron + Sigmoid (for binary classification)

Model File:
Trained model weights are saved as model.pth
Automatically loaded in the Streamlit application

Technologies Used:
Python
Streamlit
PyTorch
pandas
scikit-learn
joblib (for serialization of encoders, scalers, etc.)

Prerequisites:
